# MfTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.0.

## How to run it

- `npm i`,
- `npm run start:shell`.

The gulp file is just an util: it simply creates an entry (`index.js`) for each mf in order to easily load it.
Both micro frontends are loaded from the shell public folder.
